                        <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                        <P>Elephants are the largest living land animals. Three living species are currently recognised:
                        the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), the African forest elephant (L. cyclotis), 
                            and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). They are the only surviving members of the family 
                            Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea; extinct relatives include mammoths and mastodons. 
                            Distinctive features of elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, 
                            pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive grey skin. The trunk is prehensile, bringing food and water 
                            to the mouth and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons 
                            and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body 
                            temperature as well as in communication. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas 
                            Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level                        
                        </P>
                        <p>Elephants belong to the family Elephantidae, the sole remaining family within the order Proboscidea. 
                            Their closest extant relatives are the sirenians (dugongs and manatees) and the hyraxes, with which 
                            they share the clade Paenungulata within the superorder Afrotheria.[6] Elephants and sirenians are 
                            further grouped in the clade Tethytheria.</p> 
                            <P><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></P>
                            <P>you will find the Elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre</P>
